    <h2>The national dish of Finland</h2>
    <p>
      From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karelian_hot_pot" target='_blank'>Wikipedia:</a><br>
      The Karelian hot pot (British) or Karelian stew (US) is a traditional Finnish meat stew<br>
      originating in the region of Karelia. It is commonly prepared using a combination of pork<br>
      and beef, but elk or lamb can also be used.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The hot pot is typically seasoned with black peppercorns, salt, bay leaves and allspice.<br>
      Common vegetables such as carrots, onions, and root vegetables are acceptable additions<br>
      to the stew.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most other Karelian foods, the Karelian hot pot is traditionally<br>
      braised (cooked in a pot (uuniruukku or pata in Finnish) placed inside an oven).<br>
      In Finnish-speaking Karelia, it is usually referred to as merely 'stew' (paisti)<br>
      or 'oven stew' (uunipaisti). The term Karelian hot pot can be used to refer to nearly<br>
      any food that contains meat and that is prepared in this traditional Karelian fashion.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the scarcity of meat in the past, the hot pot was traditionally prepared only for<br>
      festive occasions. As meat became more readily available during the 20th century,<br>
      the dish became a common, everyday food throughout Finland.<br>
