    <h2>The national dish of Finland</h2>
    <p>
      From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karelian_hot_pot" target='_blank'>Wikipedia:</a><br>
      The Karelian hot pot (British) or Karelian stew (US) is a traditional Finnish meat stew<br>
      originating in the region of Karelia. It is commonly prepared using a combination of pork<br>
      and beef, but elk or lamb can also be used.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The hot pot is typically seasoned with black peppercorns, salt, bay leaves and allspice.<br>
      Common vegetables such as carrots, onions, and root vegetables are acceptable additions<br>
      to the stew.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most other Karelian foods, the Karelian hot pot is traditionally<br>
      braised (cooked in a pot (uuniruukku or pata in Finnish) placed inside an oven).<br>
      In Finnish-speaking Karelia, it is usually referred to as merely 'stew' (paisti)<br>
      or 'oven stew' (uunipaisti). The term Karelian hot pot can be used to refer to nearly<br>
      any food that contains meat and that is prepared in this traditional Karelian fashion.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the scarcity of meat in the past, the hot pot was traditionally prepared only for<br>
      festive occasions. As meat became more readily available during the 20th century,<br>
      the dish became a common, everyday food throughout Finland.<br>

    <h3>Ingredients*</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ kg beef round steak (naudan ulkopaisti or kulmapaisti)</li>
      <li>¼ kg pork round steak (porsaanpaisti)</li>
      <li>1 big onion (sipuli)</li>
      <li>2 carrots (porkkana)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt (suola)</li>
      <li>10 whole allspice berries (maustepippuri)</li>
      <li>1 bayleaf (laakerinlehti)</li>
      <li>Water (vesi)</li>
      <li>A bit of butter (margariini/voi)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps*</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Peel the onion and carrots. Chop into big cubes. Cut the meat into 3 x 3 cm cubes.<br>
        Butter the surface of a large stew pot.</li>
      <li>Brown meat cubes in a separate pan with butter.Brown evenly for a great taste<br>
        and color. After browning, add everything into a pot for the stew.</li>
      <li>Rinse the pan used for browning the meat with water and pour the water into the pot.<br>
        The water should only just cover the meat and veggies, but not any higher.<br>

      <li>Let stew slowly simmer for 2-3 hours in an oven at 175°C. If the meat starts<br>
        to get really burned, cover the meat with foil or a lid.</li>
