      Boiled egg, the unsong hero of busy daily life for millions of people.<br>
      This humble meal rarely gets praised despite its high protein content,<br>
      <strong>egg</strong>ellent <strong>shell</strong>-life (see what I did there?) and taste that
      satisfies the most.

    <p>
      Boiled egg is truly a blessing to humanity. Now if only someone figured out<br>
      how to peel those damn things without ripping out half of the boiled egg with<br>
      the shell pieces. Seriously sometimes it feels like the position of the moon<br>
      affects the peeling process more than any tips in some silly online recipe.<br>
      But without further ado, let's get on with this online recipe on how to<br>
      cook a boiled egg!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>An egg (add more based on hunger level)</li>
      <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Add water to a pot and heat up the water until it starts to boil</li>
      <li>
        Add egg (or eggs) into the pot. Use a spoon to lower the egg<br>
        slowly into the pot. This reduces the chance of the egg<br>
        breaking immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        Depenging on your preference let it cook for:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>6-7min (runny yolk)</li>
          <li>8-9min (soft yolk)</li>
          <li>10-12min (hard-boiled egg)</li>    
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the eggs from the water and immediately put them into cold water<br>
        and let the eggs cool down. Ice bath is even better I hear but I've never<br>
        bothered with that.<br> 
      </li>
      <li>Pray to the god(s) of your choice and the egg peeling spirits</li>
      <li>Peel the egg(s)</li>
      <li>
        For extra fancy occations you may add some salt on top of<br>
        the eggs to intensify the flavors
      </li>
    </ol>
