    <h2>Hot water with some leaves? Well why not!</h2>
    <p>
      If you thought I was scraping the barrel with my <a href="./boiled-egg.html">boiled egg</a> recipe oh boy were you wrong.
      Tea (the drink) comes from tea leaves that are dried and the usually packed inside handy<br>
      pourous pouches (called tea bags) for ease of use. Oh and btw tea leaves themselves grow<br>
      on tea plants, I know, a shocker!
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many varities of teas. Most common ones are green, white, black and yellow tea.<br>
      More versions exist and if we also count all the versions that don't necessary have<br>
      tea leaves in them but some other plants like ginger or some mixture of spices our options<br>
      are almost unlimited. The instructions on this page can be used pretty much with any<br>
      kind of tea.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tea variety based on your own preference (I prefer green tea or chai)</li>
      <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil water</li>
      <li>Pour the hot water into a cup</li>
      <li>Add the tea</li>
      <li>
        Let it brew for few minutes (around 3min with green tea). It's always a good<br>
        idea to check the tea package. They usually list the optimal brew time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enjoy your tea as it is or you can add some sugar/honey and if you want to be
        adventurous (and also possibly British) you can even add a bit of milk!
      </li>
    </ol>
